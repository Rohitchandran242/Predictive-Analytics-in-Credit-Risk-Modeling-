Bank Loan Analysis: A Case Study

Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of bank loan applications, providing valuable insights into how financial institutions can optimize their lending processes while effectively mitigating risks. The study delves deep into the loan approval process and identifies key variables that play a crucial role in the decision-making process.

Objective
The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate the likelihood of a customer defaulting. The information extracted can be used to make informed decisions, such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants. Understanding the key factors behind loan defaults allows banks to make data-driven lending decisions.

Tech Stack
Microsoft Excel 2016

Dataset
The analysis is based on the application_data.csv file which contains detailed information about loan applications.

Key Findings
Identification of outliers in various financial categories underscored their pronounced effect on loan approval decisions. Notably, discrepancies in reported total income, employment duration, credit amount, annuity, goods price, and family member count were significant red flags.

Methodology
This project employs a robust methodology designed to navigate the complexities of credit risk analysis. Here are the key phases of our analytical approach:

Data Cleaning
Our initial step involves rigorous data cleaning processes to ensure the integrity of our analyses. This includes handling missing values, dealing with outliers, and ensuring that our data conforms to a structure conducive to advanced analytical techniques. In particular, we've addressed outliers in financial entries, which have a substantial impact on loan decisions.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In the EDA phase, we delve into the dataset to uncover underlying patterns and insights. This involves a range of statistical techniques and data visualization methods to understand the distribution of data, the relationship between variables, and to identify potential predictors for loan defaults.

Feature Engineering
Based on our EDA findings, we engineer features that enhance the predictive power of our models. This involves creating new variables, transforming existing ones, and selecting relevant features for modeling.
