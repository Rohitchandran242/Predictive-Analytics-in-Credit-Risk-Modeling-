Bank Loan Analysis: A Case Study
Introduction
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of bank loan applications, providing valuable insights into how financial institutions can optimize their lending processes while effectively mitigating risks. The study delves deep into the loan approval process and identifies key variables that play a crucial role in the decision-making process.

Objective
The main aim of this project is to identify patterns that indicate the likelihood of a customer defaulting. The information extracted can be used to make informed decisions, such as denying the loan, reducing the loan amount, or lending at a higher interest rate to risky applicants. Understanding the key factors behind loan defaults allows banks to make data-driven lending decisions.
